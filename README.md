Compared to traditional RDP systems, which are typically built using proprietary software and protocols, a JavaScript and Node.js-based system can offer several advantages:

- **Open-source**: JavaScript and Node.js are both open-source technologies, which means that the code is freely available and can be modified and extended by developers.

- **Platform independence**: Since JavaScript is a web-based technology, a JavaScript and Node.js-based system can be accessed from any device with a web browser, regardless of the operating system.

- **Scalability**: Node.js is known for its ability to handle large amounts of data and traffic, making it a suitable choice for building scalable applications.

- **Flexibility**: JavaScript and Node.js offer a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build custom solutions for specific use cases.

- Overall, a JavaScript and Node.js-based RDP alternative can offer a flexible and scalable solution for remote access and control, with the potential for customization and integration with other technologies.
